# SQL-PROJECTS
    This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL to derive 
meaningful business insights. The dataset contains information about orders, pizzas, 
order details and sales transactions, allowing us to explore various patterns and trends 
in pizza sales.
     I structured my analysis into three levels: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced, covering a 
range of SQL queries from simple aggregations to complex joins and revenue analysis
